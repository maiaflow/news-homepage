## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS
- SCSS
- Eric Salvi, my front end mentor <3. This time we built the project together using Visual Studio Code Live Share and Zoom screen share! We are submitting the same solution with different readmes.

### What I learned

```html
      <picture>
        <source 
          srcset="./assets/images/image-web-3-desktop.jpg"
          media="(min-width: 678px)"
        />
        <img
          src="./assets/images/image-web-3-mobile.jpg"
          alt="web3 hero image"
        />
      </picture>
```

This really stumped us on one of our meetings, and I was happy I found this solution!

### Continued development

I want to get better at Git. Eric is pretty good at it and I'm pretty okay, but I want to be really good. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: A Guide to the Responsive Images Syntax in HTML](https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/) - So helpful for the <picture> element!
